# random-contest
Simple app for generating random contests between friends

For running the application just execute
```terminal
npm run start
```

For running on dev mode:
```terminal
npm run dev
```

## EmailJS config
For sending emails you would need an account in emailjs.com and provide the following config
  - ServiceID
  - TemplateId
  - PublicKey

Any information is stored on any system so each time you want to use the app you will need to introduce it again.

Soon it will be running on randomcontest.vicsan.dev
